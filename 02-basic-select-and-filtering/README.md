# 02 — Basic SELECT & Filtering

Practice SQL queries focused on retrieving and filtering data using the `SELECT` statement.

## What’s inside
- creating a database and a table for querying
- choosing appropriate data types
- inserting multiple rows of data
- preparing data for basic `SELECT` queries
- filtering with `WHERE`
- comparison operators (`=`, `<>`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`)
- logical operators (`AND`, `OR`)
- range filtering with `BETWEEN` / `NOT BETWEEN`
- pattern matching with `LIKE` / `NOT LIKE`
- filtering sets of values using `IN` / `NOT IN`
- handling `NULL` values with `IS NULL` / `IS NOT NULL`

## Files
- `easy_drinks.sql` — creates the `easy_drinks` table and inserts sample data used for querying
- `queries.sql` — example `SELECT` queries using `WHERE`, comparison operators, logical operators, and filtering techniques such as `BETWEEN`, `LIKE`, `IN`, and `NULL` handling

## Notes
This section focuses on searching and filtering data using `SELECT` with `WHERE` clauses and common SQL operators.
